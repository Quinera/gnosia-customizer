# gnosia-customizer — Extended Fork (WIP)

This repository is a functional fork of the original **gnosia-customizer** project.
It adds new customization systems focused on character dialogue behavior, profile editing, and data-page overrides.

This mod is built on **BepInEx 5** and **HarmonyX**, and works on the **Steam (PC) version of Gnosia**.

Original repository: https://github.com/shapeintheglass/gnosia-customizer

## ✅ Added Features (Fork Enhancements)

### **1. Per-Speaker Nickname Overrides**
Characters can now refer to each other differently depending on who is speaking.
This enables:
- Calling one person by surname while calling another by a pet name
- Character-specific relationship dynamics

A mapping of **speaker → target → nickname** is supported.

---

### **2. Profile Override Support**
Fields on the crew data page can now be replaced:
- bio1
- bio2 (Gina only)

---

### **3. Age Field Now Accepts Strings**
The `age` field can now be any string, not just a number.

Examples:
- `"Unknown"`
- `"Timeless"`
- `"1,000,000 years old"`

Useful for supernatural, comedic, or abstract character concepts.

---

### **4. Special Notes Text Replacement**
All special notes can be replaced through the YAML config.
This enables:
- Rewriting or adding unique flavor text

---

The following extensions are supported by this fork.

nicknames:
  Comet: "Comet-chan"

```

### 2. Special Notes Text Example
Add the following to the config.yaml file for the character you want to change:
```yaml
notes:
